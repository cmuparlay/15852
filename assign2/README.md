# Assignment 2

You need to implement the function "hotspots" in the file hotspot.h

To install parlay and download the graph files:

`> make install`

To compile:

`> make hotspots`

To run:

`> make runsmall`

or

`> make runlarge`

These should all run with the stub that is included, but, of course, not give the right answers.

You can look into the Makefile to see what they are doing.
